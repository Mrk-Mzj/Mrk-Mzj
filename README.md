### Hi, I'm Marek

I am an experienced Senior Graphic Designer and a beginner Python developer. But not a complete newbie. 😉

Coding is one of my many hobbies that I keep coming back to: 
- I started at age 10 with **BASIC** on the C64.
- I wrote in **Turbo Pascal** on my first PC.
- In college, I learned the basics of **C and C++**.
- Then I wrote some advanced Flash websites in **Action Script**.
- I tried the basics of front-end and even **Java**.

But it was 🐍**Python** that made me finally decide to change my profession.

Let's see how it goes. 😊
