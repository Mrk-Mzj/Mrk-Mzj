### Hi, I'm Mark! 🙂

I am an experienced **Senior Graphic Designer** and a beginner **Python developer**. But not a complete newbie. <br> I studied Automation and Robotics. And coding is one of my many hobbies that I keep coming back to:
- I started at age 10 with **BASIC** on the C64.
- I wrote in **Turbo Pascal** on my first PC.
- In college, I learned the basics of **C and C++**.
- Then I wrote some advanced Flash websites in **Action Script**.
- I tried the basics of **HTML**, **CSS** and some backend **Java**.

But it was **Python** that I loved. It convinced me to change careers.

Let's see how it goes. 😊
